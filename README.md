# mlops-e2e

### Project Overview

This project is the final project of part [mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main).

The **MLOps E2E** project is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline, focusing on the deployment, monitoring, and automation of machine learning models. The project incorporates various tools and frameworks, including Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and Helm, to manage and orchestrate machine learning workflows.

#### Air Quality Pipeline

One of the primary pipelines included in this project is the **Air Quality Pipeline** (`pipeline/dags/air_quality.py`). This pipeline is responsible for ingesting air quality data, performing preprocessing, and subsequently training and evaluating machine learning models to predict air quality levels. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, which ensures that each step of the workflow is executed in the correct sequence, with proper logging and monitoring.

The air quality data is processed to handle missing values, normalize features, and engineer relevant features before feeding it into a machine learning model. This model is then deployed and monitored for performance, with alerts and logging integrated into the workflow to ensure robust operation in a production environment.


### Prerequisites

Followings are Prerequisites to run the pipeline, most probably it should also work with latest versions 

- **Docker**: 24.0.5
  **minikube**: v1.33.1
  **kubectl**: v1.26.0 (use v1.30.0+ per warning from minikube)
  **helm**: v3.15.3

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start Minikube

Initialize Minikube with the desired CPU and memory resources:

```bash
minikube start --cpus 12 --memory 6144
```

This command starts a Minikube cluster with 12 CPUs and 6144 MB of memory, providing enough resources to run your Kubernetes workloads.

### Step 2: Enable Minikube Tunnel

To expose your Kubernetes services to the host machine, run:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

This command is essential for accessing services deployed in the cluster from your local machine.

### Step 3: Apply Airflow Requirements ConfigMap

Apply the ConfigMap for Airflow requirements:

```bash
kubectl apply -f helm/config_maps/airflow-requirements.yaml
```

This step configures the necessary Python dependencies for Airflow.

### Step 4: Install Prometheus

Install Prometheus using Helm to monitor your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install prometheus-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/kube-prometheus
```

Prometheus will be used to collect metrics from your cluster and applications.

### Step 5: Install Grafana

Install Grafana using Helm for visualizing the metrics collected by Prometheus:

```bash
helm install grafana-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/grafana
```

Grafana provides a powerful dashboarding and visualization capability for your metrics data.

### Step 6: Install Apache Airflow

Deploy Apache Airflow using Helm with the custom configuration:

```bash
helm install airflow-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/airflow -f helm/airflow_config.yaml
```

Airflow orchestrates your machine learning workflows, managing tasks and dependencies in your pipeline.

### Step 7: Install MLflow

Deploy MLflow for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment:

```bash
helm install mlflow-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/mlflow -f helm/mlflow_config.yaml
```

MLflow tracks experiments, manages models, and facilitates deployment in a scalable environment.

   - Use the search bar at the top to run queries and visualize the data being monitored.

## Accessing Grafana and Setting Up Alerts

Grafana is a powerful monitoring and visualization tool that allows you to create custom dashboards and set up alerts for various metrics. Here's how you can access Grafana and set up an alert to monitor your Airflow instance.

### Steps to Access Grafana

1. **Get the Grafana Application URL**:

   Run the following commands in your terminal to forward the Grafana port to your local machine:

   ```bash
   echo "Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   kubectl port-forward svc/grafana-release 8080:3000 &
   ```

   This command will make Grafana available on your local machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

2. **Get the Admin Credentials**:

   Retrieve the admin credentials for Grafana by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   echo "User: admin"
   echo "Password: $(kubectl get secret grafana-release-admin --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.data.GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" | base64 -d)"
   ```

   Use these credentials to log in to the Grafana web interface.

### Setting Up Alerts in Grafana

Once you're logged into Grafana, you can set up alerts to monitor your systems. Here’s an example of how to set up an alert if Airflow has failed more than 2 times:

1. **Create a Dashboard**:

   - In Grafana, go to the "Create" button (plus icon) in the left-hand menu and select "Dashboard".
   - Add a new panel to this dashboard by selecting "Add new panel".

2. **Query the Airflow Metrics**:

   - In the new panel, write a Prometheus query to get the count of failed Airflow tasks.
   - Example query:
     ```prometheus
     sum(rate(airflow_task_fail_count[5m])) > 2
     ```

   This query checks if there have been more than 2 Airflow task failures in the last 5 minutes.

3. **Set Up the Alert**:

   - Below the query editor, click on the "Alert" tab.
   - Click on "Create Alert".
   - Set the condition to trigger the alert when the query returns a value greater than 2.
   - Configure the alert frequency and notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

4. **Save the Dashboard**:

   - Give your dashboard and panel a name.
   - Save the dashboard so that the alert is active.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider checking the logs for each service:

- For Airflow: `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=airflow`
- For Prometheus: `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus`
- For Grafana: `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana`
- For MLflow: `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=mlflow`
